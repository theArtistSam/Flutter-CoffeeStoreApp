# CoffeeStoreApp - Flutter

CoffeeStoreApp is a mobile application developed using Flutter that allows users to browse and order coffee products from a virtual store. The app follows the principles of clean architecture to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

2. **Dashboard**: The dashboard screen displays various coffee products available for purchase, promotions, and other relevant information.

3. **Details Page**: The details page provides users with detailed information about a specific coffee product, including its name, description, price, and rating.

4. **Order Page**: The order page allows users to view and manage their orders, including adding or removing items from the cart.

5. **Delivery Page**: The delivery page enables users to track the delivery status of their orders and view estimated delivery times.

- Seamless integration of Google Fonts for consistent typography throughout the app.
